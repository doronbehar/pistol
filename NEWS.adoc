== 0.1.4

Empty lines are now skipped when config file is parsed, and not crashing Pistol.

== 0.1.3

Dependencies were updated to their latest, thanks to
https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/[renovate] for the reminder, and a
small bug in config file parsing was fixed,
(https://github.com/doronbehar/pistol/issues/31[#31]).

== 0.1

https://github.com/doronbehar/pistol/releases[v0.1] Introduced a breaking
change to the config format, which you may have experienced when using Pistol
with a custom command:

....
[bat error]: '%pistol-filename%': No such file or directory (os error 2)
....

Basically, after hitting
https://github.com/doronbehar/pistol/issues/16[issue #16], I realised
that the old way Pistol substituted the file name in your config was not
scalable. So now, please replace every occurrence of `%s` with
`%pistol-filename%`. Or with:

[source,sh]
----
sed -i 's/%s/%pistol-filename%/g' ~/.config/pistol/pistol.conf
----
